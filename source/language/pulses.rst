Pulse-level descriptions of gates and measurement
=================================================

To induce the quantum gates and measurements of a circuit, qubits are
manipulated with classically-controlled stimulus fields. The details of
these stimuli are typically unique per-qubit and may vary over time due
to instabilities in the underlying systems. Furthermore, there is
significant interest in applying optimal control methodologies to the
construction of these controls in order to optimize gate and circuit
performance. As a consequence, we desire to connect gate-level
instructions to the underlying microcoded
:cite:`wilkesBestWayDesign1989` stimulus programs emitted by
the controllers to implement each operation. In OpenQASM we expose
access to this level of control with pulse-level definitions of gates
and measurement with a user-selectable pulse grammar.

The entry point to such gate and measurement definitions is the ``defcal`` keyword
analogous to the ``gate`` keyword, but where the ``defcal`` body specifies a pulse-level
instruction sequence on *physical* qubits, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

   defcal rz(angle[20] theta) $0 { ... }
   defcal measure $0 -> bit { ... }
   defcal measure_iq $q -> complex[32] { ... }

We distinguish gate and measurement definitions by the presence of a
return value type in the latter case, analogous to the subroutine syntax
defined earlier. Furthermore, the return value type does not need to return a
classified value but can return some lower level data.

The reference to *physical* rather than *virtual*
qubits is critical because quantum registers are no longer
interchangeable at the pulse level. Due to varying physical qubit
properties a microcode definition of a gate on one qubit will not
perform the equivalent operation on another qubit. To meaningfully
describe gates as pulses we must bind operations to specific qubits.
QASM achieves this by prefixing qubit references with ``$`` to indicate
a specific qubit on the device, e.g. ``$2`` would refer to physical
qubit 2.

One can define a `defcal` using an arbitrary `$` identifier, provided that gate is called using physical
qubits. For instance, to define an equivalent `rz` calibration on qubits 0 and 1, we could write

.. code-block:: c

   defcal rz(angle[20] theta) $q { ... }
   // we've defined ``rz`` on arbitrary physical qubits, so we can do:
   rz(3.14) $0;
   rz(3.14) $1;


As a consequence of the need for specialization of operations on
particular qubits, the same symbol may be defined multiple
times, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

   defcal h $0 { ... }
   defcal h $1 { ... }

and so forth. Some operations require further specialization on
parameter values, so we also allow multiple declarations on the same
physical qubits with different parameter values, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

   defcal rx(pi) $0 { ... }
   defcal rx(pi / 2) $0 { ... }

Given multiple definitions of the same symbol, the compiler will match
the most specific definition found for a given operation. Thus, given,

#. ``defcal rx(angle[20] theta) $q  ...``

#. ``defcal rx(angle[20] theta) $0  ...``

#. ``defcal rx(pi / 2) $0  ...``

the operation ``rx(pi/2) $0`` would match to (3), ``rx(pi) $0`` would
match (2), ``rx(pi/2) $1`` would match (1).

Users specify the grammar used inside ``defcal`` blocks with a
``defcalgrammar "name"`` declaration. One such grammar is a
`textual representation of OpenPulse <openpulse.html>`_ specified by:

.. code-block:: c

   defcalgrammar "openpulse";

Note that ``defcal`` and ``gate`` communicate orthogonal information to the compiler. ``gate``'s
define unitary transformation rules to the compiler. The compiler may
freely invoke such rules on operations while preserving the structure of
a circuit as a collection of ``gate``'s and ``subroutine``'s. The ``defcal`` declarations instead define
elements of a symbol lookup table. As soon as the compiler replaces a ``gate``
with a ``defcal`` definition, we have changed the fundamental structure of the
circuit. Most of the time symbols in the ``defcal`` table will also have
corresponding ``gate`` definitions. However, if a user provides a ``defcal`` for a symbol
without a corresponding ``gate``, then we treat such operations like the ``opaque`` gates
of prior versions of OpenQASM.

Inline calibration blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As calibration grammars may require the ability to insert top-level configuration information, perform program setup, or make inline calls
to calibration-level instructions, OpenQASM supports the ability to declare a ``cal`` block. Within the ``cal`` block the
semantics of the selected calibration grammar are valid. The ``cal`` block may capture values from the enclosing scope, but the scope of values declared within ``cal``
block are determined by the calibration grammar designers. In practice, calibration grammars such as OpenPulse may apply
a global scope to all identifiers in order to declare values shared across all ``defcal`` calls thereby linking them together.

.. code-block:: c

   OPENQASM 3;
   defcalgrammar "openpulse";


   cal {
      // declare global channel
      getchannel d0 = getchannel("drive", $0);
      // declare global frame
      frame d0f = newframe(5.0e9, 0.0);

   }

   defcal x $0 {
      waveform xp = gaussian(1.0, 160t, 40dt);
      // References channel and frame declared in top-level cal block
      play(d0, xp, d0f);
   }


Restrictions on defcal bodies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contents of ``defcal`` bodies are subject to the restriction they must have a definite length
known at compile time, regardless of the parameters passed in or the state of the system when
called. This allows the compiler to properly resolve ``lengthof(...)`` calls and
allows for optimizations. If there is to be control flow in the ``defcal``, each branch of the
control flow must have definite and equivalent length resolvable at compile time. Similarly, loops
must be have a resolvable definite length at compile time.

For example,  consider the case of a ``reset`` gate. The ``defcal`` for a
``reset`` gate can be composed of a single if statement, provided each branch
of the if statement has definite and equivalent length.

.. code-block:: c

   defcal reset $0 {
      bit res = // measure qubit $0
      if (res == 1) {
         // flip the qubit
      } else {
         // delay for an equivalent amount of time
      }
   }
